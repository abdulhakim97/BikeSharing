# Summary:
This data shows that their is a lot of activity in the time of august for bike riding and sharing throughtout the year of 2019. Most of the rides are used by young males which indicates a target demographic. Another thing this data includes is the hours of rush hour in the morning and late in the afternoon are more often then not the most popular time of bike use which probably indicates a huge part this reason is because of traffic in the morning and afternoon. This could be used for another data plot point for a future story.
